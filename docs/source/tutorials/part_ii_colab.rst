Part II: Tapqir analysis (Google Colab)
=======================================

In this tutorial we will use a Jupyter notebook to run Tapqir in Colab. The notebooks contains explanatory text, Python commands that you can run by clicking on them, and will display the Tapqir user interface. The notebook is set up to analyze the Data set A in `Ordabayev et al., 2022`_.
The data are taken from `Rosen et al., 2020`_ and have already been preprocesssed using imscroll (`Friedman et al., 2015`_).  The notebook also explains how to edit the commands to analyze your own datasseet instead.
