Tutorials
=========

To help new users get started with Tapqir, this section teaches the basics of Tapqir (Tutorial Part I)
and gives step-by-step instructions for an analysis run on a sample data set (Tutorial Part II).  There
is also a Part III giving examples of further analysis of the output of a Tapqir run.

The tutorials labeled "Generic" apply to any processing environment.  Those labeled "Linux" are specific
for running on a Linux system, and those labeled "Colab" are Jupyter notebooks that can be run in the cloud
on Google Colab.  See the Part II and III tutorials for information about the requirements for running
the software in each environment.
